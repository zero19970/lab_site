### **Abstract**

<p align="justify">Background: The hypoxic tumor microenvironment accelerates the invasion and migration of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a hypoxia gene signature for predicting the outcome in stage I/II CRC patients that have limited therapeutic options.

<p align="justify">Methods: The hypoxic gene signature (HGS) was constructed using transcriptomic data of 309 CRC patients with complete clinical information from the CIT microarray dataset. A total of 1877 CRC patients with complete prognostic information in six independent datasets were divided into a training cohort and two validation cohorts. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the prognostic value of HGS.

<p align="justify">Results: The HGS consisted of 14 genes, and demarcated the CRC patients into the high- and low-risk groups. In all three cohorts, patients in the high-risk group had significantly worse disease free survival (DFS) compared with those in the low risk group (training cohort—HR = 4.35, 95% CI 2.30–8.23, P < 0.001; TCGA cohort—HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.09–4.21, P = 0.024; meta-validation cohort—HR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.08–3.39, P = 0.024). Compared to Oncotype DX, HGS showed superior predictive outcome in the training cohort (C-index, 0.80 vs 0.65) and the validation cohort (C-index, 0.70 vs 0.61). Pathway analysis of the high- and low-HGS groups showed significant differences in the expression of genes involved in mTROC1, G2-M, mitosis, oxidative phosphorylation, MYC and PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathways (P < 0.005).

<p align="justify">Conclusion: Hypoxic gene signature is a satisfactory prognostic model for early stage CRC patients, and the exact biological mechanism needs to be validated further.
