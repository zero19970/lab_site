### **Abstract**

<p align="justify">Recent evidence suggests that endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) alone is sufficient for treating T1 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who are at low risk for developing lymph-node metastasis (LNM); while the more extensive radical surgery (RS) is only needed for high-risk patients1, 2. Unfortunately the current risk-stratification criteria based on the post-endoscopic pathological examination, which includes, positive surgical margins, poor tumor-differentiation, presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, depth of submucosal invasion (>1000 um) and high-grade tumor budding; tend to overestimate the degree of risk, and inadvertently categorize >70–80% of T1 CRCs into the high-risk category. However, in reality, based upon post-surgical pathology results, only 8–16% of all T1 CRC patients are truly LNM–positive, while a majority of them unnecessarily undergo RS procedures1, 3. This is a significant clinical challenge, as these surgeries are expensive and associate with various complications including higher mortality rates4, 5. We previously reported a miRNA signature that allowed robust detection of high-risk T1 CRC patients6. While, recent evidence has highlighted the importance of gene expression in stratifying CRC patients into distinct consensus molecular subtypes (CMS)7, no studies have yet undertaken a comprehensive effort to identify gene expression signatures for the detection of LNM in T1 CRC patients.
